# FlowStream AI Overview

FlowStream AI is a production-ready analytics cockpit for ecommerce leaders who need a single pulse check across multiple storefronts. Built with Next.js 15 and TypeScript, it blends real-time operational telemetry with automated Lighthouse audits and flow metrics so teams can track web performance, delivery throughput, and customer experience quality from one screen.

## Value Proposition
- Unifies web performance, accessibility, best-practice, and SEO results alongside Agile flow indicators (throughput ratio, WIP health, quality scores, and cycle times).
- Surfaces improvement opportunities via a hybrid AI engine that mixes deterministic rules with optional OpenAI suggestions.
- Ships with a Vercel-friendly architecture, enabling teams to launch a secure dashboard quickly and scale to production workloads.

## Product Highlights
- Multi-project portfolio view with health snapshots, trend charts, and drill-down detail pages.
- Incremental static regeneration keeps dashboards fast while ensuring data freshness without constant re-renders.
- In-memory data layer wrapped in a repository patternâ€”swap in a persistent database without rewriting business logic.
- SVG-based charting library tailored to the platform, avoiding heavyweight UI dependencies while remaining fully responsive.
- Built-in API layer for project and metric ingestion, guarded by middleware that enforces API-key authentication.

## AI & Automation
- Lighthouse integration collects core web vitals across projects, optionally powered by Google PageSpeed Insights for live audits.
- Suggestion engine captures common ecommerce optimization gaps (slow pages, accessibility regressions, flow bottlenecks) and explains the rationale for each recommendation.
- When OpenAI credentials are present, the system augments rule-based insights with context-aware guidance grounded in observed metrics.

## Operations & Deployment
- Works locally with Node.js 18+, npm, and `.env.local` configuration; includes Playwright-powered accessibility audits for targeted pages.
- Deploys seamlessly to Vercel: configure API keys, connect the repository, and leverage platform caching defaults.
- Extensible architecture supports new metrics by updating shared types, repository adapters, API routes, and UI components.

## Ideal Users & Scenarios
- Ecommerce platform teams juggling multiple brand sites and needing a unified health scorecard.
- Delivery leads who monitor flow metrics (cycle time percentiles, WIP, throughput) alongside customer-facing performance.
- Agencies offering retained optimization services and looking to automate diagnostics and recommendations for clients.

FlowStream AI condenses performance telemetry, delivery analytics, and guided actions into a single source of truth, helping ecommerce organizations close the loop between measurement and continuous improvement.
