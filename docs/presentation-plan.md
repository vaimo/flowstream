# FlowStream AI – 7-Minute Presentation Plan

## 0:00 – 1:00 | Hook & Context
- Open with ecommerce performance pain points: juggling storefronts, siloed metrics, slow manual audits.
- Introduce FlowStream AI as the unified dashboard for performance, accessibility, and delivery flow.
- State the promise: faster decisions, automated insights, production-ready stack.

## 1:00 – 2:30 | Audience & Use Cases
- Identify target users: ecommerce directors, delivery leads, optimization agencies.
- Describe common scenarios (multi-brand monitoring, release readiness checks, retained optimization services).
- Highlight how FlowStream AI fits existing workflows (API ingestion, KPI reporting cadence).

## 2:30 – 4:00 | Product Tour
- Show the multi-project landing page with health snapshots and trend charts.
- Drill into a project detail page: Lighthouse scores, flow metrics, and suggestion cards.
- Call out responsive design, custom SVG charts, and ISR-backed freshness.

## 4:00 – 5:30 | Architecture & AI Differentiators
- Outline the Next.js 15 + TypeScript foundation, repository-driven data layer, and API authentication middleware.
- Explain Lighthouse integration pipeline and optional Google PageSpeed connectivity.
- Cover the hybrid suggestion engine: deterministic rules plus OpenAI augmentation when credentials exist.

## 5:30 – 6:30 | Operations & Adoption
- Walk through setup: environment variables, local dev, Playwright-based accessibility audit script.
- Share deployment path on Vercel and how to extend metrics or charts with minimal touchpoints.
- Mention roadmap hooks (database swap, additional KPIs, integration hooks).

## 6:30 – 7:00 | Close & Call to Action
- Recap the value: single source of truth for ecommerce performance and flow.
- Invite collaboration (feedback, pilots, contributions) and point to repo/next steps.
- Leave one compelling KPI or testimonial-ready statement to anchor the takeaway.
